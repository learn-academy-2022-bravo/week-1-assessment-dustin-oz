# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: In my own words, a conditional statement is a way to imbue your code with logic. They let you perform actions based on whether certain conditions are met.

  Researched answer: W3 SCHOOLS DEFINITION: Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: In my own words, GIT is an open source versioning tool used by developers to track changes in your code base.

  Researched answer: www.git.scm answer: Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: If I remember correctly, the JavaScript operators that return Boolean values are those operators that deal with comparison operations such as ==,===,>,< and a few others.

  Researched answer: W3Schools Answer: Comparison AND Logical operators are used to test for true or false.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: Within an array, each element is assigned a location index with the first position in the array starting at index 0 and counting up. Value would be the numerical or textual representation of each element within the array. For example in the array [1,2,3] The number 1 has an index of 0 and a value of 1. 

  Researched answer: Index: The location of an item in an array.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: In my own words, iteration is the process by which code is executed repeatedly until a condition is met.

  Researched answer: Loops allow programs to perform repetitive tasks, such as iterating through an array, while adhering to the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself). They come in handy when you want to execute a function a number of times, using different sets of inputs each time.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: One developer will control the input of the code while a second developer directs the other what to code. To be successful, the pair would swicth positions on occasion so that each gets a chance to code as well as the chance to direct it.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator,[1] reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A “higher-order function” is a function that accepts functions as parameters and/or returns a function.

2. Jest: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework, designed and built with a focus on simplicity and support for large web applications.

3. Objects: An unordered collection of key-value pairs. let object = { Make: 'Ford', Model: 'Mustang', Year: '2022' }

4. Method: An Action that can be peformed on objects.

5. Classes: A blueprint for creating objects.
